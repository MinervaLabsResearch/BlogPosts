# MinerKiller
These scripts were extracted from cryptomining malware. <br> You can use them as a resource for IOC or as a base for your own PowerShell and bash scripts to remove miners during incident response.<br>We added some comments to clarify the original code where we believed it was needed.

**Note that the scripts are provided with no liablity and should not be used without understanding their bits and bytes!**

The first script was released in this blog post:<br>
