**PuffStealer String Deobfuscator**
This script will deobfuscate the AutoIt script discussed in Minerva Labs' blog post:
https://blog.minerva-labs.com/puffstealer-evasion-in-a-cloak-of-multiple-layers

It uses regular expressions to cleverly search (decrypt) and replace the obfuscated strings.
Note that it seems to be a packer used by other malware as well and can be used to handle it as well, with slight modifications.
